Yes, on Linux, you can interact with the global menu of an application using C by leveraging the **GTK** (GIMP Toolkit) or **Qt** libraries, depending on the toolkit the application is using. The global menu is part of the **AppMenu** protocol (sometimes referred to as **DBus AppMenu**), which allows an application's menus to be integrated with a desktop environment's global menu system (such as Unity, GNOME, or other desktop environments that support it).

### Steps to interact with the global menu in C:

1. **Install the necessary dependencies**:
   - For GTK, you need the GTK+ development libraries.
   - For Qt, you need the Qt development libraries.
   - Additionally, you need **libappmenu-gtk-module** (for GTK applications) or **libappmenu-qt5** (for Qt applications) installed on your system to integrate with the global menu.

2. **Using DBus for AppMenu**:
   - The global menu communication is typically done via **DBus**, a messaging system used for communication between processes in Linux.
   - Applications using the AppMenu DBus interface can expose their menu structure to the system via DBus.

3. **GTK Global Menu (via DBus)**:
   - You can interact with the AppMenu by using the **GTK** or **Qt** framework to hook into the DBus interface that exposes the menu.
   - GTK provides a way to interact with DBus through its own **AppMenu** module (via `libappmenu`), but you can also directly access DBus interfaces if you want to manipulate or query the menu.

4. **DBus API for AppMenu**:
   - The global menu is usually exposed on the `org.freedesktop.Application` DBus interface. You can call methods on this interface to get menu information or manipulate it.
   - You can use `libdbus` (a C library for DBus) to access and interact with this interface.

Here’s an example of how you might interact with DBus in C to get an application's menu (note: this is simplified):

### Example using DBus in C:

```c
#include <dbus/dbus.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void check_dbus_error(DBusError *err) {
    if (dbus_error_is_set(err)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "DBus Error: %s\n", err->message);
        dbus_error_free(err);
        exit(1);
    }
}

int main() {
    DBusError err;
    DBusConnection *conn;
    DBusMessage *msg;
    DBusMessageIter args;
    dbus_uint32_t serial = 0;

    dbus_error_init(&err);

    // Initialize DBus connection to the session bus
    conn = dbus_bus_get(DBUS_BUS_SESSION, &err);
    check_dbus_error(&err);

    // Create a new DBus message to call the AppMenu API
    msg = dbus_message_new_method_call("org.freedesktop.Application",  // destination
                                      "/org/freedesktop/Application", // object path
                                      "org.freedesktop.Application", // interface
                                      "GetMenu");                   // method name

    if (msg == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Message Null\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    // Call the method on the bus
    DBusMessage *reply = dbus_connection_send_with_reply_and_block(conn, msg, -1, &err);
    check_dbus_error(&err);

    // Process the response (this is simplified, real processing would be more complex)
    if (reply != NULL) {
        printf("Received global menu data.\n");
        dbus_message_unref(reply);
    }

    dbus_message_unref(msg);
    dbus_connection_unref(conn);

    return 0;
}
```

This is just a starting point and does not cover all the complexities of interacting with the menu system, but it demonstrates how you can use DBus in C to interact with system services, like the global menu.

### Additional Notes:
- Depending on the desktop environment you're targeting, you might need to use specific libraries. For instance:
  - **GNOME** uses GTK and often exposes its AppMenu through DBus.
  - **KDE** with Qt may require using Qt's `QDBus` API to interact with the global menu.
  
- Global menu support can vary between desktop environments, and not all applications will expose their menus via DBus. For full compatibility, you may need to ensure your application or the system supports global menus properly.

Ah, I see! You want to render the **global AppMenu** (i.e., the application's menu) inside your GTK window. This typically involves creating a GTK application where the menus of another application (rendered globally via the AppMenu API) are displayed within your own window. 

To clarify, what you're aiming for is to embed the **global AppMenu** of another application into your GTK window. This requires integrating with the **AppMenu DBus interface**, which enables accessing menus of applications globally (those that expose their menu via the AppMenu DBus API).

Unfortunately, GTK by itself does not have direct functionality for **embedding** an AppMenu from another application into a window. The process requires using **DBus** to interact with the global menu system. Here's how it works:

1. The application menu (AppMenu) is typically exported to the DBus interface by the application.
2. You would use **DBus** to access the menu structure from a specific application.
3. After retrieving the AppMenu, you'd embed it into your GTK window.

The process is not trivial, as it involves interacting with the DBus interface and interpreting the AppMenu structure, which is typically serialized as DBus objects.

### High-Level Approach:

1. Use **DBus** to interact with the AppMenu of another application.
2. Retrieve the menu structure (which is usually a set of DBus objects).
3. Render that menu structure inside your GTK window.

### Key Libraries:
- **libdbus**: To interact with the DBus API and retrieve the menu from another application.
- **GTK**: To render the menu structure inside your window.

This example focuses on the DBus interaction part and is simplified.

### Step-by-Step Example:

1. **Set Up DBus Interaction in C**: First, we'll access the AppMenu exposed by another application via DBus.

2. **Embed Menu into GTK Window**: After interacting with DBus, we would theoretically insert the AppMenu into a GTK window.

Here’s a skeleton example of how to set up the DBus interaction and create a GTK window to embed the menu. The actual embedding would require deeper integration with the AppMenu protocol, but this should give you a starting point.

```c
#include <gtk/gtk.h>
#include <dbus/dbus.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Callback function for "Quit" menu item
static void on_quit_activate(GtkMenuItem *item, gpointer user_data) {
    gtk_main_quit();
}

// Function to initialize DBus and fetch the AppMenu
void get_app_menu_from_dbus() {
    DBusConnection *conn;
    DBusMessage *msg, *reply;
    DBusError err;
    dbus_uint32_t serial = 0;

    dbus_error_init(&err);

    // Connect to the session bus
    conn = dbus_bus_get(DBUS_BUS_SESSION, &err);
    if (dbus_error_is_set(&err)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to connect to DBus: %s\n", err.message);
        dbus_error_free(&err);
        return;
    }

    // Call the AppMenu's DBus interface to fetch the menu
    msg = dbus_message_new_method_call(
        "org.freedesktop.Application",  // Destination
        "/org/freedesktop/Application", // Object path
        "org.freedesktop.Application",  // Interface
        "GetMenu"                       // Method
    );
    
    if (msg == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Message Null\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    // Send the message and get a reply
    reply = dbus_connection_send_with_reply_and_block(conn, msg, -1, &err);
    if (dbus_error_is_set(&err)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to get DBus reply: %s\n", err.message);
        dbus_error_free(&err);
        dbus_message_unref(msg);
        dbus_connection_unref(conn);
        return;
    }

    // Here you would parse the reply to extract the menu
    // For simplicity, we're just printing a placeholder for the menu

    printf("Received AppMenu data (for simplicity, not parsed):\n");
    dbus_message_print(reply);
    
    // Clean up DBus objects
    dbus_message_unref(msg);
    dbus_message_unref(reply);
    dbus_connection_unref(conn);
}

// Function to create the GTK window
void create_window() {
    GtkWidget *window;
    GtkWidget *menu_bar;
    GtkWidget *app_menu_item;

    window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
    gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), "AppMenu Example");
    gtk_window_set_default_size(GTK_WINDOW(window), 400, 300);

    // Create the menu bar
    menu_bar = gtk_menu_bar_new();

    // Here, you'd integrate the fetched AppMenu into the menu bar
    app_menu_item = gtk_menu_item_new_with_label("AppMenu");
    // Assuming you have a menu to set
    gtk_menu_shell_append(GTK_MENU_SHELL(menu_bar), app_menu_item);

    // Add the menu bar to the window
    gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), menu_bar);

    // Set up the window signal to destroy the window
    g_signal_connect(window, "destroy", G_CALLBACK(gtk_main_quit), NULL);

    // Show the window and all widgets
    gtk_widget_show_all(window);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    gtk_init(&argc, &argv);

    // Fetch the AppMenu via DBus
    get_app_menu_from_dbus();

    // Create and display the window
    create_window();

    // Run the GTK main event loop
    gtk_main();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **DBus Interaction (`get_app_menu_from_dbus`)**:
   - This function sets up a DBus connection to the session bus, sends a message to retrieve the AppMenu from a target application (using `GetMenu`), and prints out a placeholder for the menu data.
   - In real code, you would need to parse the response and extract the menu structure.

2. **GTK Window (`create_window`)**:
   - This function creates a basic GTK window and a menu bar, where the AppMenu would theoretically be embedded.

### Key Notes:
- **DBus Parsing**: In the `get_app_menu_from_dbus()` function, the menu data returned is currently not parsed. You would need to process the DBus reply, extract menu items, and display them in your GTK window.
- **Integration with DBus**: This example shows how to call the AppMenu via DBus, but the real complexity comes in processing the DBus reply and rendering the menu inside GTK.
- **Menu Rendering**: Rendering the menu inside GTK from the DBus response is quite complex and would require understanding the specific menu structure used by the AppMenu protocol.

### Compiling:

```bash
gcc `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` -o appmenu_example appmenu_example.c -ldbus-1
```

### Running:

```bash
./appmenu_example
```

This example sets up the basics for fetching and displaying the global AppMenu of another application. However, actual AppMenu integration inside GTK requires parsing the DBus response and rendering it appropriately, which can get quite complex.
