Great question! If you want to render **text to the right of an image rendered with `chafa` in C**, the concept is similar to the Python approach:

### ‚úÖ Summary of What You Need to Do in C:

1. Run `chafa` on an image using `popen()` to get its ANSI-rendered output line by line.
2. Store the image lines.
3. Define your accompanying text lines.
4. Print the image line with the corresponding text line side by side.

### üß± Here's a Minimal C Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_LINES 1000
#define MAX_LINE_LENGTH 1024

int main() {
    FILE *fp;
    char *image_lines[MAX_LINES];
    char buffer[MAX_LINE_LENGTH];
    int image_line_count = 0;

    // Open chafa process
    fp = popen("chafa --fill=space your-image.png", "r");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        perror("Failed to run chafa");
        return 1;
    }

    // Read chafa output into image_lines
    while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), fp) != NULL && image_line_count < MAX_LINES) {
        image_lines[image_line_count] = strdup(buffer);
        image_line_count++;
    }

    pclose(fp);

    // Define text lines to print to the right of the image
    const char *text_lines[] = {
        "This is a caption.",
        "Rendered next to",
        "the image using C.",
        "Supports ANSI colors!",
        "Enjoy!"
    };
    int text_line_count = sizeof(text_lines) / sizeof(text_lines[0]);

    // Determine number of lines to print
    int max_lines = image_line_count > text_line_count ? image_line_count : text_line_count;

    // Print image + text side by side
    for (int i = 0; i < max_lines; i++) {
        if (i < image_line_count) {
            // Print the image line (already contains ANSI codes)
            fputs(image_lines[i], stdout);
            // Remove trailing newline if needed
            if (image_lines[i][strlen(image_lines[i]) - 1] == '\n') {
                printf("\033[K");  // Clear to end of line
            }
        } else {
            // If no image line, print padding
            printf("%*s", MAX_LINE_LENGTH - 1, " ");
        }

        // Padding between image and text
        printf("  ");

        // Print corresponding text line
        if (i < text_line_count) {
            printf("%s", text_lines[i]);
        }

        printf("\n");
    }

    // Free memory
    for (int i = 0; i < image_line_count; i++) {
        free(image_lines[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### üõ† Compile and Run

```bash
gcc -o chafa_text chafa_text.c
./chafa_text
```

> Make sure to replace `"your-image.png"` with a real image path.

---

### ‚úÖ What This Does:

* Runs `chafa` and captures its ANSI output line by line.
* Prints the image with accompanying text aligned on each line.
* Handles varying line counts between image and text.

---

### üîç Notes

* Terminal should support ANSI escape codes and UTF-8 (for best results).
* You can tweak the `--size`, `--symbols`, or `--format` options in `chafa` to control image appearance.
* Add error checking and dynamic resizing as needed for robustness.

Let me know if you want to adapt this for dynamic input, wide Unicode support, or ncurses integration!
